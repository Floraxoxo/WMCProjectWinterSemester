            Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) has played a pivotal role in shaping the visual appearance of the World Wide
            Web, providing a standardized way to describe the presentation of web pages.
            The development of CSS can be traced back to the early days of the internet when Tim Berners-Lee, the
            inventor of the World Wide Web, recognized the importance of separating content from presentation.<br><br>
            Before the development of CSS in 1996 by the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C), Web pages were extremely
            limited in both form and function.
            Early browsers presented a page as hypertext - plain text, images and links to other hypertext pages.
            There was no layout at all to speak of, merely paragraphs running across the page in a single column.
        </p>
        <section id="beginning">
            <h2><b>Beginning</b></h2>
            <p>
                In the early days of the web, styling elements on a webpage was embedded directly within HTML documents.
                This approach led to cumbersome and convoluted code, making it challenging to maintain and update the
                visual aspects of a website.
                The first proposal for a web stylesheet was made in 1993, and several more followed until 1995.
            </p>

                             width="350">

                    <div class="col-md-8">
                        <div class="card-body">
                            <p class="card-text">
                                On October 10th in 1994 Håkon Wium Lie published the first concept for "Cascasding HTML
                                style sheet" short CHSS.
                                Later he partnered up with Bert Bos in order to create CSS together.
                                After Lie's presentation of CSS at the Mosaic and the Web conference in Chicago in 1994
                                and later with Bos in 1995, the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) became aware of CSS.
                                Lie and Bosen continued to work on CSS with other members within this framework. <br>
                                In December 1996 the CSS Level 1 Recommendation was published.

                                The first iteration, CSS1, was introduced in December 1996.
                                It provided a basic yet transformative set of styling features.
                                Web developers could now control font styles, colors, and spacing, separating the
                                presentation layer from the underlying HTML structure.
                                This newfound flexibility allowed for cleaner code, improved maintenance, and a more
                                efficient design process.

                Despite its revolutionary potential, CSS1 faced challenges in its early days, including limited browser
                support and inconsistencies.
                Nevertheless, it paved the way for the subsequent evolution of Cascading Style Sheets.
                CSS1's significance lies in its role as the catalyst for a new era in web design, emphasizing the
                importance of separating content and presentation—a principle that continues to shape modern web
                development practices.

            <h2><b>CSS2 & CSS2.1</b></h2>
            <p>
                Released in 1998 by the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C), CSS2 represented a notable advancement in the
                capabilities of web styling.
                Building upon the foundation laid by CSS1, it brought crucial features that empowered web designers with
                more control over page layouts.
                CSS2 introduced properties for positioning, floating elements, absolute positioning, and enhanced
                styling options, providing the tools for creating more sophisticated and complex designs.
                However, despite its advancements, browser inconsistencies hampered widespread adoption initially.
            </p>
            <p>
                CSS 2.1, introduced in 2011, represented a refinement of CSS2, addressing ambiguities and
                inconsistencies present in the earlier version.
                It focused on clarifying the specification to ensure consistent interpretation across browsers.
                CSS 2.1 aimed to improve interoperability and reduce discrepancies in rendering, providing a more stable
                foundation for web developers.
                While it did not introduce new features, its emphasis on standardization contributed to a more reliable
                and predictable styling experience across different browsers.
            </p>
            <p>
                Both CSS2 and CSS2.1 played significant roles in the evolution of web design, laying the groundwork for
                subsequent advancements in Cascading Style Sheets.
                Their influence is still felt today as the web development community continues to build upon the
                principles and standards established by these early specifications.

                Despite the advancements introduced by CSS2, widespread adoption faced challenges due to persistent
                browser inconsistencies.
                The early 2000s witnessed a turning point for CSS with the emergence of projects like the CSS Zen

                                Introduced in 2003 by web designer Dave Shea, the CSS Zen Garden showcased the potential
                                of CSS by demonstrating how a single HTML document could be transformed into myriad
                                visually distinct designs through CSS styling alone.
                                The Web Standards Project (WaSP) also contributed to this movement by urging browser
                                makers to adhere to established standards, leading to improved consistency in CSS
                                support across different browsers.

                                As web design requirements evolved, the need for more advanced styling capabilities led
                                to the development of CSS3.
                                This evolution was fueled by a desire to go beyond the basic visual appeal of websites
                                and cater to a growing demand for enhanced interactivity and responsiveness.
                                CSS3, succeeding CSS2, addressed these evolving demands by offering a more extensive
                                toolkit of styling tools and features.

                CSS3 introduced a plethora of enhancements, including rounded corners, gradients, transitions, and
                animations. Selectors were expanded, enabling more precise targeting of elements.
                Media queries were introduced, facilitating responsive design by allowing styles to adapt to different
                devices and screen sizes.

                In the contemporary web development landscape, CSS has become an integral part of creating visually
                appealing and responsive websites. The browser wars of the past have subsided, with modern browsers
                offering robust and consistent support for CSS standards.
            </p>
            <p>
                Looking ahead, discussions around CSS continue, with proposals for new features and refinements.
                Concepts such as container queries and the Houdini project, which aims to give developers more control
                over the browser's rendering engine, hint at a future where CSS will continue to evolve and adapt to the
                ever-changing demands of web design.
            </p>
            <p>
                In conclusion, the history of CSS is a narrative of innovation, overcoming challenges, and the
                collaborative efforts of the web development community. From its humble beginnings as a solution to
                styling complexities, CSS has matured into a powerful language that shapes the visual identity of the
                digital landscape, with its impact extending far beyond simple webpage aesthetics.
